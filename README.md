# Neural-Network-Flappy-Bird-AI

In this project we train a flappy bird AI using a basic neural network evolutionary algorithm. We do not use any libraries in our code. 

The result is an AI that can play the game indefinitely. If the AI does make it 18000 frames into the game, we end the current generation and start the next one, as this is an adequate level of success.
